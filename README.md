# Project Euler Solutions

A collection of my solutions to problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

## Structure

Each problem is organized in its own directory named after the problem number. Solutions are primarily written in Python, with some problems including additional files such as:
- Problem descriptions (`.png` files)
- Input data files (e.g., `0059_cipher.txt` for Problem 59)
- Alternative implementations (e.g., C++ for Problem 61)

## Running Solutions

To run a solution, navigate to the problem directory and execute the Python file:

cd 2
python 2.py
## Notes

- Solutions are written for clarity and correctness rather than optimization
- Some problems include problem statement images for reference
